I've not had the motivation to work on this the last few days. I don't know what the 'game' actually is, just these bits that I've cobbled together. I'm going to try to make a TODO list to see if that will help my motivation and spur some inspiration to put some finishing touches on it.

#### TODO

- [x] ability to screenshake
  - [x] fix up messages when picking up keys related to hiding the cursor
